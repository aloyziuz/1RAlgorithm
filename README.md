1RAlgorithm
===========

Data mining project: create a program to execute a data mining algorithm
A simple non-GUI OneR Algorithm
Created using NetBeans

There are 2 files that can be run
Both are OneR Algorithm but differs in the pre-processing method
One is using error-based discretization and the other is using equal-width discretization
Procedures on how it works can be read on the .java files
files starting with OneRAlgorithm... is where the main function is

Limitations:
  Attribute values must all be numeric
  First line must be attribute names or headers
  The separator must be a comma (,)
  Class category should be categorical
  Class category should be placed in first column
